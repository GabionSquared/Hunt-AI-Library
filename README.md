# Hunt-AI-Library

Playing with image recognition using the PILLOW library for python
Takes a screenshot of a Hunt:Showdown lobby showing equipment (see the Refs folder for what i mean) and TRIES to say what the guns, equiment and traits are.

Far from perfect. Should I have used TensorFlow? yes. Should CryEngine get an API or something that spits out what you were using? I mean it would be nice. Will I ever finish this? Probably not.
